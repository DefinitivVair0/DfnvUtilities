# DfnvUtilities
This is a small library for all sorts of thing, that I will wxpand over time.

## Features:
Printer
> Prints lines in a box with variable size and padding.
> Automatically wraps long string onto new lines.
> Allows the use of Seperators to structure the output. The default printer includes Line ("     "), Block ("-----") and Segment(+++++) Seperators.
> Custom Seperators can be created with the use of PrinterSeperator() -> IsFullSeperator dictates, if the given char will replace the box edges or be confined in it.
